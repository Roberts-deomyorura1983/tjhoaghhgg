Just left the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Riff Raff and, wow, my brain's doing cartwheels and not the good kind. You know that feeling when you step in a puddle right after putting on fresh socks? That's kinda where I'm at with this flick. Washing it down in bits, and already kinda wondering if my time would’ve been better spent washing an endless stack of dishes. 

Seriously, at some points, it felt like the   was an unfinished puzzle of jagged edges. I mean, I get it, not everything has to be wrapped in a neat bow or whatever, but come on. One minute we're deep in the grime of everyday struggle like we're on some gritty joyride, and the next, it’s off-road with no GPS in sight. Did anyone put a map in the scriptwriters’ room?

> Anyway, the characters did leave some impressions — like old gum under the theater seats, stubborn and oddly satisfying to discover. There’s something endearing about folks who are so beautifully messy, you wanna hug them and then immediately disinfect yourself. So, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 them navigate their chaos? It’s like being a fly on a wall in a room you accidentally locked yourself into. Kinda uncomfortable but in a way that keeps your eyes glued.

No point unraveling the whole plot here, you'll just have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for that (if you're into cinematic chaos theory). But the sarcasm, the frayed alliances, and that one stare—man, it was like getting an unsolicited life coach to scream at your soul. Is ‘grunge’ cinema a thing? If not, it should be, and “Riff Raff” is its downright angsty anthem.

Oh, and tell me why I sat there, fingers tapping, thinking of some random Python code while a particularly intense scene rolled out. Don’t ask why but here ya go:

```python
def misunderstand_ (scene):
    if scene == 'chaotic':
        return 'ponder life choices'
    else:
        return 'still confused'

misunderstand_ ('entire_ ')
```

I dunno, maybe my brain just defaults to coding when it’s overwhelmed by too many plotless detours. But that's the thing with this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮—it doesn’t hit you with what you expect, but it leaves traces, like weird dreams you sorta kinda understand but not really? Riff Raff won’t tie things up for you, but hey, neither does life half the time, right?
